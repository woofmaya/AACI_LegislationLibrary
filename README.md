# AACI_LegislationLibrary
AACI Presidential Initiative Legislation Library


This is the repo for the AACI Legislation Library developed in Spring 2019 by the Carnegie Mellon 373 team. In order to create/edit a local version of this project, you must clone this repo, install CraftCMS, connect it to a local database, setup a web server, and enable Craft's project config. After changes are made to your local version, once you push to this git repo, DeployBot will automatically deploy to the live site. You should be making changes to your local version in a dev environment, and the live site is solely in a production environment. See technical documentation for more details.
